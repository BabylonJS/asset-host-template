# Babylon.js Asset Host Template

## Quick Start Guide

1. Use GitHub to create `your-asset-repo` from this template
2. In the directory in which you want to develop, clone `your-asset-repo`
3. `cd your-asset-repo`
4. `npm install`: NPM will install required dependencies
5. `npm run dev`: NPM will serve this repos "docs" folder as an asset host on port 8181

You can now add your own assets to the "docs" directory to be hosted 
locally and/or committed to the repository to be served from a 
[GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) site.

6. Drag-and-drop an asset (such as "image.png") into the "docs" folder
7. Access your hosted asset at https://localhost:8181/image.png, from the browser or from code

## About This Repository

This repository is intended to be a "jumping off point" for moving
ideas from prototyping into active development. This repo provides a 
mechanism for basic asset hosting kept separate from software development.
This separation is part of the recommended workflow for creating Babylon.js
experiences which can eventually be integrated in other projects for 
circulation. For more information, check out the
[docs page](https://TODO-make-a-docs-page-for-this).
